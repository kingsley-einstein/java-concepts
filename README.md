Relearning core Java concepts
================================

This project is aimed at me relearning possibly forgotten or not yet leveraged concepts in the Java programming language.

```java
 public class Learning {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println("Hello world. Join me in this quest");
  }
 }
```

|Concept | Description | Things Done |
|---------|-------------|-------------
|Annotation    | Decorators that add code metadata        | :sparkles: Print annotations and annotated elements

:sparkles: Null (Still working on this) |
